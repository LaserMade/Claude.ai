Quick Access Popup
==================

Portable installation
---------------------

Follow these instructions if you want to use Quick Access Popup in "portable" mode. This
will, for example, allow you to run it from an external drive or USB key. You’ll just
need to unzip a file.

1) Download quickaccesspopup.zip.

2) There is no software to install. Just extract the zip file content to the folder of your choice.

Note: It is recommended not to install Quick Access Popup in system-protected folders like those
under "C:\Program Files". This could prevent QAP from saving your configuration.

3) Run the .EXE file from this folder (choose the file QuickAccessPopup-32-bit.exe or
QuickAccessPopup-64-bit.exe depending on your system). Quick Access Popup will create and update
the quickaccesspopup.ini file in this folder. See Quick Access Popup is a Portable App, below.

4) At your convenience, create a shortcut on your Desktop or your Start menu or select
"Run at startup" in the Tray menu to launch Quick Access Popup automatically at startup.

See also the file UPDATE_INSTRUCTIONS.TXT for the best way to install a new version over an
existing portable installation.


Update instructions
-------------------

1) Download the new version zip file under Portable installation on this site home page.

2) Quit your current version of Quick Access Popup: right-click the Quick Access Popup icon in the
System Tray and choose Exit Quick Access Popup. If you don't before executing the next step, QAP
will not be updated.

3) Extract the new version zip file content in the folder where your current version is installed,
*overwriting* all existing content. Do not worry: this will NOT overwrite your settings in
QuickAccessPopup.ini and your dynamic menus data in QAP_Frequent.DB because these files is not part
of the ZIP file. All your settings and favorites will be preserved.

4) For your information, a text file was added to your folder with, in its name, the version of the
installed version (for example: QAP-v9_0_1.txt). You can delete this file as it is not required to
run QAP.

5) Restart Quick Access Popup by double-clicking the executable (.EXE) file of the new version.
Choose the 32-bit or 64-bit version depending on your system.

If you enabled this "Run at startup" option, the shortcut in your Startup folder will be updated
to launch the new version when you will restart Windows.


Quick Access Popup Context menus
--------------------------------

If you want to use QAP context menus, you will have to create registry keys on the host PC. See the
following instructions.

To install context menus, open the file "QuickAccessPopup-InstallContextMenus_reg.txt" and follow
the instructions within.

To remove context menus, open the file "QuickAccessPopup-RemoveContextMenus_bat.txt" and follow the
instructions within.

Quick Access Popup is a Portable App
------------------------------------

A portable application (portable app), sometimes also called standalone, is a program designed
to run on a compatible computer without being installed in a way that modifies the computer’s
configuration information. This type of application can be stored on any storage device, including
internal mass storage and external storage such as USB drives and floppy disks – storing its
program files and any configuration information and data on the storage medium alone
(source: Wikipedia).

Specifically, Quick Access Popup does not write any information in any system or temporary Windows
folder. Running the .EXE file launches Quick Access Popup in its current directory. That’s it!
The app creates a temporary subdirectory (named _temp) to store small images and language files
required at run time. This folder is deleted when the app quits. The only permanent file created
by Quick Access Popup is the QuickAccessPopup.ini file containing your favorites and options.

The file QuickAccessPopup.ico included in this zip file contains the app's icon that you can use to
customize the Quick Access Popup's folder or shortcut.
