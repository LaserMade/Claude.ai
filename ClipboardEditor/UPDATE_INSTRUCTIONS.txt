Quick Clipboard Editor
======================

UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS FOR PORTABLE INSTALLATION

Using the portable installation

1. Download the new version zip file under Portable installation on this site home page.

2. Quit your current version of Quick Clipboard Editor: right-click the Quick Clipboard Editor icon in the System Tray and choose Exit Quick Clipboard Editor. If you don't before executing the next step, QCE will not be updated.

3. Extract the new version zip file content in the folder where your current version is installed, *overwriting* all existing content. Do not worry: this will NOT overwrite your settings in QuickClipboardEditor.ini because this file is not part of the ZIP file. All your settings will be preserved.

4. For your information, a text file was added to your folder with, in its name, the version of the installed version (for example: QCE-v1_0_1.txt). You can delete this file as it is not required to run QCE.

5. Restart Quick Clipboard Editor by double-clicking the executable (.EXE) file of the new version. Choose the 32-bit or 64-bit version depending on your system: QuickClipboardEditor-32-bit.exe or QuickClipboardEditor-64-bit.exe.

If you enabled this option, the shortcut in your Startup folder will launch the new version when you will restart Windows.
